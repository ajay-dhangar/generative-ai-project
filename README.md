## Introduction

Generative AI, also known as generative modeling, involves using machine learning techniques to generate new data instances. This project explores different generative AI techniques and provides implementations for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Features

- Implementation of various generative AI algorithms
- Experimentation with different datasets
- Applications showcasing the capabilities of generative models

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajay-dhangar/generative_ai_project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project is organized into subdirectories, each containing implementations of different generative AI models. You can navigate to each subdirectory to explore the implementations and run the provided scripts.

Here are some examples of how to use the project:

- **Image Generation**: Navigate to the `image_generation` directory and run the `generate_images.py` script to generate synthetic images using generative adversarial networks (GANs).

- **Text Generation**: Explore the `text_generation` directory to find implementations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for text generation tasks.

Feel free to experiment with the provided code and modify it according to your requirements.
